	<!-- <h2>Hi there, I'm Shishir Patil!</h2> -->
    	<p>I am a Research Fellow at <a href ='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/'>Microsoft Research India</a>. I am advised by <a href='http://www.prateekjain.org/'>Prateek Jain</a> from the <em>Machine Learning and Optimization Group</em> and <a href='http://harsha-simhadri.org/'>Harsha Vardhan Simhadri</a>, <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/visesha/'>Vivek Seshadri</a> from the <em>Systems Group</em>.

        </p>

        <p>Update: <a href = 'https://nips.cc/Expo/Conferences/2018/Schedule?demo_id=3'> We will be presenting our work at NIPS 2018!</a>

    <h3>I am currently working on:</h3>

                <li><a href ='https://github.com/Microsoft/EdgeML'>Intelligent Devices Expedition: </a>
                Machine learning predictions on edge devices (microcontrollers) are critical in many scenarios where we are constrained by latency and bandwidth or value data privacy and battery life. e.g., Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable electronics. In this project, we are designing new ML algorithms that generate tiny models that can enable prediction on edge devices with accuracies comparable to cloud solutions. <!-- These algorithms can be deployed on microcontrollers that use milliwatts of power and have just a few kB of RAM. -->
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>PulsCity: Deploying IoT for urban cities involves 3 challenges:
                    (a) Deploying sensor systems that capture the physical phenomenon (b)
                    Transmission of data from the sensors to cloud/server and (c)
                    Getting meaningful insights from the data.
                    In this project, we propose novel techniques to build a scalable framework to address the communication component - transmission of data from the sensors to a centralized server.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p> Prior to this, I obtained a B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from R.V.
            College of Engineering in 2017 (awarded University Gold Medal). During my undergraduate 
            program, I worked with <a href ='http://www.cense.iisc.ac.in/m-m-nayak'>Prof. M.M. Nayak</a>
            from Center for Nano Science and Engineering, <a href = 'http://www.iisc.ac.in/'>Indian 
            Institute of Science</a> from 2016-2017. I was an intern with Siemens R&D in the
            summer of 2015.</p>
