	<h2>Hi there, I'm Shishir Patil!</h2>
    	<p>I am a Research Fellow at <a href ='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/'>Microsoft Research India</a>. I am advised by <a href='http://www.prateekjain.org/'>Prateek Jain</a> from the <em>Machine Learning and Optimization Group</em> and <a href='http://harsha-simhadri.org/'>Harsha Vardhan Simhadri</a>, <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/visesha/'>Vivek Seshadri</a> from the <em>Systems Group</em>.

                Machine learning predictions on edge devices is critical in many scenarios where we are constrained by latency and bandwidth or value data privacy and battery life. Examples of such scenarios are Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable electronics. In this project we are designing new ML algorithms that can generate extremely small models that can enable prediction on edge devices with accuracies comparable to cloud solutions. These algorithms can be deployed on microcontrollers that use milliWatts of power and have just a few kB of RAM.

                                <li>Getting meaningfull insights from the data</li>
                                In this project, we are investigating novel techniques to build a scalable framework to address the second component - transmission of data from the sensors to a server.
