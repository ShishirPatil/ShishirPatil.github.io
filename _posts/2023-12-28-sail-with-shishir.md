If I have pointed you to this page, that means we will be going sailing soon! Here are some common FAQs that I have been asked frequently when I take folks sailing. These apply for "Dinghies". For "Keelboats", you don't really have to prepare much.

## Which boats are we going to sail in? 
Depending on the number of people, and availability we will either sail on a Quest, Toura, Venture, or a JY-15.

## Can you confirm the date and time?
Sailing, is fully dependent on the winds. I will confirm the date and time 24 hours before the sail. If the weather is not good, we might have to reschedule. Generally speaking, winds of 10-15 knots is a great day to sail. Also, you can't sail during low-tides. 

## What to wear?
Wear something comfortable. Wear shoes on the boat, and do carry a pair of additional footwear to change into post the sail. There will also be sweatsuits, and water repellent jacket and pants available for free that you can borrow. It can get cold in the San Francisco Bay - so do dress appropriately. 

## Will I get wet?
You will not get drenched, but you might get slightly wet - especially your footwear. You will get fully wet if you do fall in the water. You will get wet even if the boat capsizes. We usually don't, but might. 

## What happens if the boat capsizes? 
Nothing, we just right the boat and continue. Capsizing a dinghy while sailing, is falling while ski-ing. It is a part of the sport.

## Do I need to know how to swim?
No. But do let me know if you don't know how to.
